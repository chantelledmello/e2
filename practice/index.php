        <h1> Chantelle D'mello </h1>
        <p> Hi guys! My name is Chantelle and I'm an MLA in Digital Media international student living in sunny Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
        <p> My background is in Journalism and I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Journalism from Northwestern (go Wildcats!) but have since seen my interests take me more into the digital world than the newsroom.
        <p>
            I'm halfway through my degree and have basic programming knowledge via David Malan's CS50 and Lisa Diorio's WP class that touched on PHP.
            While I'm an aspiring frontend designer, I'm stocked to take a look 'under the hood' and learn about how server-side technologies work, especially
          if I plan to work with a CMS like WP in the future. </p>
        <p>On the personal side, I'm a third culture kid that's spent the majority of my life in Qatar and Oman. I'm also an avid foodie, cat-lover, and gym bunny.
          Excited to get cracking on this class and to e-meet all of you! </p>
