        <h1> Chantelle D'mello </h1>
        <p> Hi guys! My name is Chantelle and I'm an international Graduate student currently pursuing my MLA in Digital Media while living in sunny Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
        <p> While my background is in journalism (I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Journalism from Northwestern - go Wildcats!), I've realised
          that my true love is in creating digital products that combine graphics with storytelling to create seamless, enriching experiences. </p>

        <p>
            I'm halfway through my degree and have basic programming knowledge via David Malan's CS50 and Lisa Diorio's WP class that touched on PHP.
            While I'm an aspiring frontend designer, I'm stoked to take a peek 'under the hood' and learn about how server-side technologies work. I think it's
            an extremely valuable skill to have, especially given the rapid rise of CMSs like WP. </p>
            <p> I'm a visual thinker and learner, but I love the challenge that programming poses and the instant gratification you get when something works the way it should.
            (rare, but well worth it!)</p>
        <p>On the personal side,

          I'm a third culture kid who's spent the majority of her life in Qatar and Oman, so feel free to ask
          my about life in the desert. I'm an avid foodie, cat-lover, and gym bunny.</p>
          <p>
          Excited to get cracking on this class and to e-meet all of you! </p>
